Keyboard Input Logger
=====================

This is a simple Python script that logs keyboard input to a file.

**How it works**

1. The script uses the `pynput` library to listen to keyboard input.
2. When a key is pressed, the script appends the key character (or a string representation of the key if it's a special key) to a list.
3. When the Escape key is pressed, the script stops listening to keyboard input and writes the entire list of keys to a file named "text.txt".
4. The file is opened in append mode, so each time the script is run, the new input is appended to the end of the file.

**Usage**

1. Save this script to a file (e.g., `keyboard_logger.py`).
2. Run the script using Python (e.g., `python keyboard_logger.py`).
3. Start typing on your keyboard. The script will log all your keystrokes to the "text.txt" file.
4. Press the Escape key to stop the script and write the input to the file.

**Note**

* This script logs all keyboard input, including passwords and sensitive information. Use with caution!
* The script does not handle errors or exceptions well. If you encounter any issues, feel free to modify the script to suit your needs.

**Dependencies**

* `pynput` library (install using `pip install pynput`)
