This Python script uses the pynput library to monitor keyboard events. The pynput library provides a simple way to control and monitor input devices. Here's a breakdown of what each part of the code does:

Import Statements:
-import pynput: Imports the main pynput module.
-from pynput.keyboard import Key, Listener: Specifically imports the Key enumeration and the Listener class from the keyboard submodule of pynput. These are used to define keyboard-related 
 actions and to create a listener object that will listen for keyboard events.

Function Definitions:
-def on_press(key):: This function is called whenever a key is pressed. It takes one argument, key, which represents the key event. Inside the function, it tries to print the character 
 associated with the key press (print(f"Pressed: {key.char}")). If the key pressed is not a character (e.g., a special key like Shift), it catches the AttributeError and prints a message 
 indicating a special key was pressed instead (print(f"Special key pressed: {key}")).
-def on_release(key):: This function is called whenever a key is released. It takes one argument, key, which represents the key release event.
 Inside the function, it checks if the released key is the Escape key (if key == Key.esc:). If so, it returns False, which stops the listener from continuing to listen for further key events. 
 This effectively allows the program to exit when the Escape key is pressed.

Listener Initialization and Execution:
-with Listener(on_press=on_press, on_release=on_release) as listener:: This line creates a new instance of the Listener class, passing the on_press and on_release functions as arguments to 
 handle key press and release events. The with statement ensures that resources are properly managed; the listener starts listening for events immediately upon creation and stops listening 
 once the block of code is exited.
-listener.join(): This method call blocks the execution until the listener is stopped, either because the program ends or because the Escape key is pressed (as defined in the on_release 
 function).

In summary, this script listens for keyboard events, printing the characters of keys pressed and stopping the listener when the Escape key is released.
