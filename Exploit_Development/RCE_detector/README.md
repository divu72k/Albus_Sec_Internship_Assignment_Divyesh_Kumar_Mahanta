This is a Python script for a class that can be used to detect the presence of a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in a given URL. The class has several methods to perform the detection using different techniques:

detect_rce(self): This method uses the requests library to send a GET request to the URL and checks the response for any RCE patterns. It takes no arguments and returns True if an RCE pattern is found, False otherwise.

detect_rce_socket(self): This method uses the socket library to establish a TCP connection to the server and sends a GET request manually. It then checks the response for any RCE patterns. This method can be used as a fallback if the requests library is not available.

detect_rce_file(self): This method uses the requests library to send a GET request to the URL with /robots.txt appended. It checks the response for any RCE patterns. This method can be used to detect RCE patterns in files other than the index page.

get_host(self, url): This is a helper method that extracts the hostname from a given URL.

check_vulnerability(self, url): This method checks if a specific vulnerability (CVE-2024-31210) is present in a WordPress installation at the given URL. It sends a GET request to the URL and checks the response for a specific pattern.

_search_pattern(self, content, pattern): This is a private helper method that searches for a given pattern in a given string. It takes into account any false positives that have been defined. The class uses regular expressions to define the RCE patterns and false positives. These patterns are defined as class variables and can be customized as needed. The class also uses the requests library to send HTTP requests and the socket library to establish TCP connections.
