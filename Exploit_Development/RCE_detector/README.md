# RCE Vulnerability Detection

This Python script defines a class that can be used to detect the presence of a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in a given URL. The class includes several methods to perform the detection using different techniques.

## Features

- **detect_rce(self):** Uses the `requests` library to send a GET request to the URL and checks the response for any RCE patterns. Returns `True` if an RCE pattern is found, `False` otherwise.
- **detect_rce_socket(self):** Uses the `socket` library to establish a TCP connection to the server, sends a GET request manually, and checks the response for any RCE patterns. Can be used as a fallback if the `requests` library is not available.
- **detect_rce_file(self):** Uses the `requests` library to send a GET request to the URL with `/robots.txt` appended and checks the response for any RCE patterns. Useful for detecting RCE patterns in files other than the index page.
- **get_host(self, url):** A helper method that extracts the hostname from a given URL.
- **check_vulnerability(self, url):** Checks if a specific vulnerability (CVE-2024-31210) is present in a WordPress installation at the given URL. Sends a GET request to the URL and checks the response for a specific pattern.
- **_search_pattern(self, content, pattern):** A private helper method that searches for a given pattern in a given string, taking into account any false positives defined.

The class uses regular expressions to define the RCE patterns and false positives. These patterns are defined as class variables and can be customized as needed. The class also uses the `requests` library to send HTTP requests and the `socket` library to establish TCP connections.
