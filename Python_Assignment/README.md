PYTHON ASSIGNMENT 1:
- Most of these assignment questions were easy.
- I had to make a revisit to sorting algorithms via GeeksForGeeks.

PYTHON ASSIGNMENT 2:
- I approached the first assignment question as the function of a command called grep used in bash terminal for finding patterns in files containing huge chunks of data.
- Second assignment question was just multiplying by 69 to the user input given.
- For the third question, I used the library called requests which is used to send HTTP requests and I used its basic functionalities.
- For the fourth question, I used the library called ifcfg which is used for checking interfaces in both Windows and Linux. So this script can be applied to both Windows and Linux.
- For the fifth and last question, I used the library secrets and string. Secrets library is is used for generating random numbers for managing important data such as passwords, account authentication, security tokens, and related secrets, that are cryptographically strong.

PYTHON ASSIGNMENT 3:
- For the first question, I made two functions- rem_dup and empty_csv:
  (i) rem_dup has a list in which takes up all the entries that are not empty.
  (ii) empty_csv converts the empty entries to 'N/A'.
- For the second question, I made a function which reads lines of the files and returns the lines having the pattern string.
- For the third question, I had to revisit graph concepts and Dijkstra's algorithm and made the required functions.
- I also added some strings for better understanding.
- For the fourth question I made a class with deposit, withdraw and check_balance functions for depositing, withdrawing and checkng the balance respectively.
- For the fifth and the last question, I had to use os, shutil and tkinter libraries.
- I also had to learn about hte methods used via GeeksForGeeks and this is the only questions that took the longest to code.
